# Overview

The **To-Do List App** is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. As a software engineer, this project aims to enhance my skills in building full-stack applications using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with a simple and intuitive interface.

To start a test server on your computer, run the following commands:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the first page of the app.
Deployed web app [here](https://todo-app-nodejs-tdhk.onrender.com/)

The purpose of writing this software is to practice building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application and to gain experience with backend and frontend integration.
